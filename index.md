# Image Analysis for Archival Discovery

The Image Analysis for Archival Discovery (Aida) project responds to two issues within the digital library community: First, that we leverage little of the information potential of the millions of images that we are creating as we digitize the cultural record. Second, that locating relevant materials in digital collections is often already a difficult endeavor and will become increasingly so as more content is digitized. We are asking what more we can do with the millions of images that represent the digitized cultural record, and we are interested in the types of discovery that serious attention to digital images might yield.
